	<p> The study was conducted on the old part of Dhaka. Information was collected from people
living in establishments identified as risky by Dhaka City Corporation. A mix of qualitative
and quantitative approaches was used and social survey method was employed. Field data
was collected based on interview schedules equipped with both open ended and closed
questions.
High dependency rate and low family income are common features of the people living in
these houses. Owners live in those worn-out and risky buildings with their life risk as they
cannot afford to renovate these buildings or move out to a new place. On the other hand,
tenants live in these debris like buildings as rent of these buildings are comparatively low
and they don’t afford high rent. In a word, people with low income live in these houses with
life risk. Most of the respondents both owners and tenants don’t know that DCC has
declared their residences risky.</p>

			<p> Earthquake is the most frightful of all the natural calamities and Bangladesh, surrounded by
the regions of high seismicity, is one of the most earthquake-prone countries on earth.
Dhaka with its population of around 20 million and enormous poorly constructed structures
and least response and recovery capabilities of its residents signify extremely vulnerable
conditions for massive loss of lives and properties in the event of a moderately large
earthquake and has already been identified as the world’s most earthquake vulnerable city.
An earthquake of even medium magnitude can produce a mass graveyard in Dhaka. Old
part of Dhaka with thousands of non-engineered and dilapidated buildings in association
with very narrow roads is in the worst position.</p>
		</div>
			<p id="Pa">Earthquake cannot be prevented nor can it be precisely predicted. But destruction can be
minimized to a great extent through pre and post-earthquake management mechanism.
Consciousness and preparedness can play vital role in this regard. Unfortunately, most of
the people know very little about their dos and don’ts at an earthquake. This paper aims at
finding out the consciousness level of the most earthquake risky city dwellers of
Bangladesh and argues that most of the city dwellers are not conscious about the
impending earthquake nor do they prepared for it </p>
